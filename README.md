# Introduction to -omics

This repository contains all necessary material for the practical exercises of the "Introduction to -omics" course (UiB - BINF201).

## How to use

All practicals are self-contained. This means that you don't need data from one practical to complete another. However, some of the later practicals use concepts first explained in earlier practicals. 

All tools and data are provided on an [NREC](https://www.nrec.no/) server for students taking the course. However, the practicals contain install instructions for the used software tools, and links to the data in case you want to download it yourself.

The practicals are tested and developped on a linux system. They are not guaranteed to work on Mac or Windows. However, using [WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) should work for Windows users.
